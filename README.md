OK so . remember im not like.  a professional or anythign this is just personal tips.
i believe hte first thing for training art is finding inspiration/motivation!
so firstly u just like. make a tab on pinterest of arts you personally like and want to somehow personificate them on your art : 3

nowww that you did your tab, try finding something that is present in all arts youve saved! for me its the choice of different colors for contrast
this one for example..

the artist used blue as a background color and yellow as the main character color, cause theyre opposite colors!
in other words, using them together can be a good combo cause you can use them for contrast  : 3
see how yellow seems to get the most attention? cause its the opposite of blue!
thats part of the color theory btw!
in this case its complementary colors . i said opposite cause i forgot the name LOL

when studying color theory you'll always see the basic color wheel (RBY, RBG, among others), as its important : 3
thats the thing that defines the types of color wheels basically.
okay so now 
another good thing for evolving/developing your artstyle is art studies ! theyre really fun and good for you

let me take a example.
 example !! 
 if you have seen art studies, you might have noticed how people try to "copy" (although they're not taking the art as their own, and yes recreating for learning objectives) the original art.
 thats a method of studying !! you can understand  why an artist used these specific colors, if theres any meaning behind the art, what theyre trying to make you feel, among other things : 3.

## <p align="center"> **art by alaiganuza on insta!**

as you can see, in this art here there's a splash of colors !! theres a lot of them, which makes the art sort of ??? pop off??? idk the word. it makes it feel more alive, if thats a way to put it...
you can see how theres like. minimum change in colors here in the sink but you can see its form : 3
they used a more aqua (?) blue to do the lightest part, while using a more purplish blue to do the "depth" of the sink.
also, the amount of colors in the ..THE FAUCET. makes it feel more like metal, you know ?? like. can u see what im talking about.
it looks like metal !! its even reflecting the person in front of the sink as you can see

not only that, there's also the soap bottle here! the way the artist painted makes it look more like a soap bottle and doesnt look too .. what would be the word. um . mixed? with the background
overall this art is really good for practicing color theory and textures/materials!! 

here's some stuff i drew, too : 3
